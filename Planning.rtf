Set the chart to update using this store.

On page load, grab the top 10 stocks of the day, either from the database* or robinhood. Replace the symbol array with these top 10 symbols.

The code will already be set to update the active symbol using the first symbol in the symbol array (from above).

*The top 10 stocks should be set to run only once per day, by storing them and the time retrieved in the database.


Button click:
>> if logged out:

Log vote locally and update active symbol to the next symbol in the symbol array.

** If they then login, I want their votes to be placed into the database under their username.

>> if logged in: Every user will have their own symbol array. It includes:

                The dayâ€™s top 10 stocks

                Their past votes

                Symbols the user prefers

                Log their vote in the database under their username.
